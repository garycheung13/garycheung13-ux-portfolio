### Project Overview

#### Summary

**EMX Systems is a early stage startup healthcare company** based in Michigan developing a health information exchange platform to improve the process in which healthcare information transferred between healthcare providers using different electronic medical records (EMR) systems. Their planned platform includes an intranet web application in which doctors and other healthcare professionals can securely access patient records no matter which EMR system it originated from. As a member of the UMSI Design Clinic, I, along with four other designers, were tasked with designing the complete user experience for their web application.

#### My role

Completing this project was a team effort, and I contributed during every step of the process. I interviewed two physicians, analyzed our collective interview data, and developed our user journey. During the prototyping phase, I wasresponsible for designing the dashboard and the individual record screen. I also lead the process for developing a UI component library in Sketch to improve our team’s prototyping speed.

### The Challenge
With his decades-long career as a doctor as evidence, our client believes that current electronic record (EMR) solutions are not designed to meet the needs of healthcare providers. Many doctors have at least one complaint about their EMR. Systems are often are selected based on the needs of the hospital administrators, such as the ability to bill patients more efficiently.

Our client believes that a more provider-friendly system can be created. His new company, EMX Systems, aims to supplement existing EMRs by providing fast, secure patient data access at the point of care. Fundamentally, he challenged our team to solve the following problem for the EMX portal application:

How can a healthcare record system be design to better fit care providers’ needs?

### Our Approach
We used a user-centered design approach where users were involved at every step of the process. We conducted user research to identify problems, ideated to come up with multiple solutions, created a prototype based on our best idea, and validated our idea using usability tests. Based on test results, we iterated on our prototype. For this project, we completed four design iteration cycles.

### User Research

#### Contextual Inquiry

In order to better understand how healthcare providers actually used EMRs, we conducted 10 interviews with healthcare providers. Our interviewees group included a mix of doctors, nurses, and medical students.

We used a contextual inquiry-based approach to interviews, in which we visited interviewees at their office to ask questions their EMR usage experiences and observe them interacting with their current EMR.* Afterwards, we synthesized our interview data by building an affinity diagram.

_*Interviewees shared their own medical data or used data from patients who signed HIPAA waivers for this project._

We learned the following for our interviews:

* **Too much clutter:** Interviewees disliked that their current EMR system shows them too much irrelevant information to their job.
* **UI doesn’t match the workflow:** A higher degree of UI personalization is needed to match user’s workflows.
* **Quality of outside records is inconsistent:** Records received in EMRs from other systems are often scanned as images and therefore unsearchable, with varying levels of image quality from very good to very poor.
* **Too much complexity for needs:** Learning a new EMR system takes too long, and providers feel unproductive spending time searching for information. One interviewee noted that he need to take a multi day workshop to learn a new EMR system when it was first implemented at their hospital.
* **Double work:** If a lab or imaging result can’t be found in the current system, it can sometimes be performed again because requesting the document can take too long.

#### Survey
Although interviews provided in-depth insight into EMR usage experiences, we also wanted to get a broader overview of the reasons providers access their EMRs. For that reason, our team designed a survey on EMR usage which was taken by 20 medical professionals at the University of Michigan hospital system.

Based on our survey, **we learned** that:

* Viewing the result of imaging studies (1), imaging reports (2), and lab reports (3) were ranked as top three most common reasons for a practitioner to view a patient record.

* 75% of respondents viewed the ability to see outside records at the point of care as very important.

* Providers were generally dissatisfied (60%) with asking patients to bring in their own records before an encounter.

### Ideation

Our team used a parallel design approach to coming up with design solutions. Each designer on our team created rough wireframes for multiple ideas and then pitched each idea to the team for feedback and critique. Afterwards, we reviewed all ideas that were pitched and created one collaborative wireframe using our individual ideas as references.

### Design Solution


#### Features

<h4 class="highlighted">Dashboard: A running timeline of the patient’s history</h4>

When providers meet patients, especially for the first time, they want to know the medical history of that patient. This will involve asking patients directly, but patients can miss details that are important to making a diagnosis. What can done so that providers check that they are getting the full picture of a patient’s history?

The dashboard is designed to allow healthcare providers to see a patient history at a glance. Information is organized as in a combined feed as well as one seperated by record type.


### Outcomes

We delivered a full InVision prototype of our project to our client, detailed UI specifications, and a navigation map. After some minor visual tweeks, our client was extremely satisfied with our work and hopes to incorporate our design into the development of their product.

What our client had to say:

_The result is an excellent implementation that we can build on the EMX service platform, well done. The specifications certainly help, making our bootstrap implementation quite natural. I’ll be building out a demo ready version of your design and hope to use to as an example of how providers and designers can come together to build great products that have a real-world impact. Your teams’ insight will certainly help us meet that goal._
