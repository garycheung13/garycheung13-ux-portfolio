### Herd Immunity Visualization
---
#### Summary
I developed this explorable explanation project over the course of a month for my data visualization class. It provides an high level explaination of the how to measure the population requirements for group (herd) immunity from infectious dieases. Users are about to observe the spread of an disease in an interactive visualization where they can customize the strength the of a disease and the vaccine against it.

### MoMA and Art Movements
---
#### Summary
Our team of four worked with a dataset containing the nearly complete record of the Museum of Modern Artâ€™s collection of works to visualize geographic changes in how the collection grew during each major modern art movement. We used Python with the pandas library to clean the dataset and D3.js to implement map and bar chart visualizations.
