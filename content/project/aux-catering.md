### Overview
---
As a web developer on the University of Michigan's auxiliary marketing team, I was responsible for maintaining and building websites for the a number of student life and service departments at the school. In February of 2018, **University Catering asked our team to redesign their main website.**

#### Role

I was responsible for implementing the design based on mockups and refactoring the frontend codebase. I **integrated an API from University Dining Services** to dynamically generate the catering menu. I rewrote the frontend code to remove the dependency on the Google Blogger platform and replaced JQuery methods with native DOM API methods. **Accessibility improvements** were also made by rewriting markup **using semantic HTML, assigning ARIA properties, and adding using tabindex**.
